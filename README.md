# Shiny IV Boost — Pokemon Reborn & Rejuvenation Mod

A simple mod for **Pokemon Reborn** and **Pokemon Rejuvenation** that gives shiny Pokemon better IVs.

## What it does

When a shiny Pokemon is generated (wild encounter, gift, egg, legendary), this mod:

1. **Advantage roll** — Rolls each IV a second time and keeps the higher value
2. **Minimum floor** — Rerolls any IV that lands at 5 or below

Non-shiny Pokemon are completely unaffected. Game switches like `Full_IVs` and `Empty_IVs_Password` still take priority.

## Install — Pokemon Reborn (v19.5.0)

Reborn has built-in mod support. Just drop in the files:

1. Navigate to your Pokemon Reborn game folder
2. Create the directory `patch/Mods/` if it doesn't already exist
3. Copy **both** files from `src/` into `patch/Mods/`:
   - `shiny_iv_boost.rb` — the mod itself
   - `shiny_iv_boost_config.rb` — your settings
4. Launch the game

## Install — Pokemon Rejuvenation (v13.5.0)

Rejuvenation uses the same engine but doesn't enable mod loading by default. One extra step:

1. Navigate to your Pokemon Rejuvenation game folder
2. Open `mkxp.json` in a text editor
3. Add this line near the bottom, just before the `"bindingNames"` line:
   ```
   "patches": ["patch"],
   ```
4. Create the directory `patch/Mods/`
5. Copy **both** files from `src/` into `patch/Mods/`:
   - `shiny_iv_boost.rb` — the mod itself
   - `shiny_iv_boost_config.rb` — your settings
6. Launch the game

## Uninstall

Delete `shiny_iv_boost.rb` and `shiny_iv_boost_config.rb` from `patch/Mods/`. For Rejuvenation, you can also remove the `"patches"` line from `mkxp.json` if you have no other mods.

## Configuration

Edit `shiny_iv_boost_config.rb` in `patch/Mods/` — the mod file itself never needs to be touched.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `ENABLED` | `true` | Master toggle for the entire mod |
| `ADVANTAGE_ROLLS` | `true` | Roll each IV twice, keep the higher |
| `MIN_IV_FLOOR` | `5` | Reroll any IV at or below this value (set to `0` to disable) |
| `DEBUG_LOGGING` | `false` | Print shiny IV results to the console |

To see debug output in-game, press **F1** and check **Show Console**.

If the config file is missing, the mod still works using built-in defaults (same values as above).

## How it works

The mod uses the MKXP engine's patch system (`patch/Mods/`). It aliases `calcStats` on `PokeBattle_Pokemon` to inject the IV boost on first stat calculation — right after the base game assigns IVs but before stats are finalized. No base game files are modified.

## Compatibility

- **Pokemon Reborn v19.5.0** — works out of the box
- **Pokemon Rejuvenation v13.5.0** — works with one-line `mkxp.json` edit (see install steps)
- Does not break existing save files
- Minimal conflict risk with other mods (only touches IV generation via `calcStats` alias)
